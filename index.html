            <p>Hi, my name is Andrea! I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in History 
                and a certificate in Health Informatics. I am currently employed at Austin Regional Clinc as an Epic 
                EMR Specialist. In this role, I provide Epic Ambulatory support to the 24 Austin Regional Clinics, 
                train new providers, and participate in system upgrades through analysis and testing to support new 
                workflows and procedures.</p>

            <p>Outside of work, I like to go hiking with my dog, trying new donut places around Austin, and seeing as 
                many new movies with MoviePass before it eventually goes out of business. I am interested in learning to code, 
                and have enrolled in the UT Coding Boot Camp with the goal of finding a developing job after graduation. I am 
                excited about this new opportunity and seeing how much I can learn over the next six months.</p>
